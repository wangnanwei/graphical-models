This program is wrotten to compute different MLEs for graphical models.
To test the codes and see the outputs, you can run the test_main.m file.
There are lots of detailed explanations in that file, too.

Because we use some functions from the UGM toolbox to compute the global MLE, and minFunc to compute 
pseudolikelihood,you should download the toolbox from the following website. Uncompress the files 
and put them in the same folder directory as my codes.
